• Square / squircle 1 : 1 aspect, 64-72 px on phones, 88 px on tablets.
• Each tile contains **a thin-line icon + a single 14-16 pt label** (no second line).
• Subtle pressed scale (0.96) & shadow per Style Guide micro-interaction.
• Responsive: tiles centre in a row (≤3), wrap to two rows on iPad landscape.

- [x] 1 : 1 squircle aspect, responsive sizing.
- [x] Pressed state animation & 48 px tap-target verified in Jest snapshot.
