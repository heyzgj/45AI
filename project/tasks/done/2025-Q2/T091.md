### Description

Ensure that the template detail page uses the **same data source** as the main gallery card to display template name, credit cost, and description.  Currently values are inconsistent.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Opening any template shows matching name/credits as in gallery card.
- [x] Unit test navigates to detail page and asserts props equality.

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/pages/template-detail/index.vue`, `@/frontend/src/api/templates.ts`

### Agent Notes

Likely multiple API calls with stale cache; use Pinia store or pass route params.
