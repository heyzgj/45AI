### Description

Modify the top carousel (swiper) component so that:
1. All slides display images at 16:9 ratio (or slight vertical variation) with `object-fit: cover`.
2. No textual overlay appears on the imagesâ€”visual-only.
3. Component remains responsive and maintains ratio across devices.

**Delight Extra:** On swipe, apply a subtle 5-8 px parallax (translate-x) between foreground image and background container for tactile depth (H5 & iOS only).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Carousel images render in 16:9 aspect ratio on iPhone and iPad.
- [x] No text elements are rendered inside carousel slides.
- [x] Parallax effect activates on swipe (H5 & iOS) without jank.
- [x] Lazy loading of images still works; Lighthouse score unaffected.

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/components/HomeCarousel/`
- **Docs:** `@/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md#Motion-Animation`

### Agent Notes

Likely need to wrap `image` in `view` with `padding-bottom: 56.25%` trick or UniApp `mode="aspectFill"`.
