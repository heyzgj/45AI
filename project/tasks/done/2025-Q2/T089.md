### Description

1. Convert purchase options layout to a **2 rows × 3 columns** grid, each item a compact card displaying credit amount and price.
2. Ensure only **one** package can be selected at a time (radio behaviour); clicking another deselects previous.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Grid displays 6 credit packages in 2×3 layout on mobile and tablet.
- [x] Selecting a package highlights it (primary border & subtle shadow) and deselects others.
- [x] Focus ring visible when navigating with keyboard (accessibility).
- [x] Micro-copy under each pack shows price / credit.
- [x] Total price label updates correctly.
- [x] Snapshot test validates layout.

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/pages/purchase/index.vue`, `@/frontend/src/components/CreditPackCard/`

### Agent Notes

Store `selectedPackId` in component state; watch for style updates based on selection.
