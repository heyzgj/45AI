### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Routes defined for all pages (home, gallery, generate, profile, login, etc.)
- [ ] Page transitions implemented with fade + slide animation
- [ ] Navigation guards for protected routes
- [ ] Smooth transition performance (>55 FPS)

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md#Motion-Animation`

- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/router/`

### Agent Notes

Ensure transitions follow the custom cubic-bezier easing. Use the animation classes we created in the styles.
