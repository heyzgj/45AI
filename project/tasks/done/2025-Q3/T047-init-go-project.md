### Description

Set up the initial Go project structure with the Gin web framework. Create the main application entry point, basic folder structure, and initialize Go modules with necessary dependencies.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Go module initialized with appropriate module name
- [ ] Gin framework and core dependencies added to go.mod
- [ ] Basic main.go created in cmd/api directory
- [ ] Project runs and responds to health check endpoint
- [ ] Folder structure matches architecture specification

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/TECH_SPEC.md#Components`
- **Docs:** `@/docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md#Codebase-Organization`
- **Code:** `@/backend/`

### Agent Notes

Initialize with module name like `github.com/45ai/backend`. Include Gin, JWT, MySQL driver, and other core dependencies from the start.
