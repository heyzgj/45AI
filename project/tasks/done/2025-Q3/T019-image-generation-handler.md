### Description

Create an HTTP handler to process image generation requests. This handler will receive the user's uploaded image and the selected template ID, call the `GenerationService`, and return the generated image URLs.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A `GenerationHandler` is created with a `GenerateImage` method.
- [x] The handler correctly parses the `template_id` and the uploaded `image` from the request.
- [x] It calls the `GenerationService.GenerateImage` method with the appropriate parameters.
- [x] It returns a JSON response with the generated image URLs and a `200 OK` status on success.
- [x] It returns appropriate error responses (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `500 Internal Server Error`) on failure.

### Context Binding
