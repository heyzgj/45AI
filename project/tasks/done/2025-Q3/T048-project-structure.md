### Description

Create the complete internal package structure for the Go backend following the layered architecture pattern (Controller -> Service -> Repository). Set up proper package interfaces and basic structure.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Handler package created with interface definitions
- [ ] Service package created with business logic interfaces
- [ ] Repository package created with data access interfaces
- [ ] Model package created with base structures
- [ ] Middleware package created with basic structure
- [ ] All packages follow Go best practices

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md#Notable-Design-Patterns`
- **Docs:** `@/docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md#Codebase-Organization`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/`

### Agent Notes

Follow the repository pattern strictly. Create interfaces first, then implementations. This provides good testability and maintains separation of concerns.
