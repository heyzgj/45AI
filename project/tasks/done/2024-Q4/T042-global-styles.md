### Description

Implement the complete style system based on the Style Guide including color tokens, typography, spacing, and base component styles. Create reusable CSS variables and utility classes for consistent styling across the app.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All color tokens defined as CSS variables
- [ ] Typography system implemented with proper fonts
- [ ] Spacing scale configured using 4px grid unit
- [ ] Base component styles created (buttons, cards)
- [ ] Animation utilities with custom easing curves
- [ ] Styles work correctly on both iOS and WeChat

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/styles/`

### Agent Notes

Pay special attention to the soft, feminine aesthetic. Implement the custom cubic-bezier easing function. Ensure all animations meet the >55 FPS performance requirement.
