### Description

Implement the specific animations and transitions for the template gallery as defined in the `STYLE_GUIDE.md`. This task focuses purely on the motion design aspect.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Page transitions between the gallery and detail views use the specified "Subtle Fade + Vertical Slide" animation.
- [ ] Template cards have a tap animation (lifts up and forwards) as defined in the micro-interactions section.
- [ ] The initial loading of the gallery includes a staggered fade-in for the cards.

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md#Motion--Animation`
- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/pages/index/index.vue`, `@/frontend/src/pages/template-detail/index.vue`

### Agent Notes

*This task is critical for achieving the "premium feel" of the application. Use CSS transitions and animations. The `cubic-bezier` easing function is key.*
