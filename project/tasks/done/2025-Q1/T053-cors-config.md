### Description

Implement CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration for the API to allow frontend applications to make requests from different domains. Configure appropriate headers and methods for WeChat Mini Program and iOS app integration.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CORS middleware is implemented using gin-contrib/cors
- [x] Allowed origins include WeChat Mini Program and local development
- [x] Appropriate HTTP methods are allowed (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- [x] Required headers are configured for authentication
- [x] Preflight OPTIONS requests are handled correctly

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/TECH_SPEC.md#API-Design`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/middleware/cors.go`

### Agent Notes

*CORS configuration is essential for cross-origin requests from frontend applications.*
