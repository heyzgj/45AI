### Description

Implement request validation middleware for the Go backend using a validation library like `go-playground/validator`. This middleware will validate incoming JSON requests against struct tags and return standardized error responses.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A validation middleware is implemented that works with Gin
- [x] Request structs use validation tags (e.g., `required`, `email`, `min`, `max`)
- [x] Validation errors are returned in a consistent JSON format
- [x] The middleware is integrated into the API router
- [x] Common validation rules are implemented (email, phone, length limits)

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/TECH_SPEC.md#API-Design`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/middleware/validation.go`

### Agent Notes

*Proper request validation is crucial for API security and user experience. Use go-playground/validator for comprehensive validation rules.*
