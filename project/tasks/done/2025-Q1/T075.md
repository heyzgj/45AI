### Description

Plan and document the production deployment architecture using WeChat Cloud hosting for the backend and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for AI services. This task focuses on architectural planning and preparation, with actual deployment to be executed at the end of the project.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Document WeChat Cloud hosting setup and configuration
- [ ] Plan WeChat Cloud MySQL database configuration
- [ ] Design WeChat Cloud serverless deployment strategy
- [ ] Document native WeChat integration capabilities (OAuth, Pay, Push)
- [ ] Plan GCP ComfyUI AI service deployment with GPU
- [ ] Document CI/CD pipeline using WeChat Cloud tools
- [ ] Create deployment checklist and migration plan
- [ ] Estimate costs for both WeChat Cloud and GCP components

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/TECH_SPEC.md#Deployment`
- **Docs:** `@/docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md`
- **Code:** `@/backend/deploy/`
- **External:** WeChat Cloud documentation (https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/wxcloudservice/wxcloudrun/)

### WeChat Cloud Services

**Backend Hosting:**
- Serverless container deployment with auto-scaling
- Native WeChat ecosystem integration
- Built-in DDoS protection and dedicated network
- Zero-maintenance MySQL with auto-scaling

**Native Capabilities:**
- Free WeChat authentication (no additional setup)
- WeChat Pay integration (built-in encryption handling)
- Message push services
- Cloud calling for WeChat APIs

### GCP AI Services (ComfyUI Only)

**Compute:**
- Compute Engine with GPU (T4/V100/A100)
- Container-optimized OS
- Private network connectivity to WeChat Cloud

**Storage & Networking:**
- Cloud Storage for AI model assets
- Private VPC for secure communication
- Load balancing for multiple AI instances

### Integration Architecture

- WeChat Cloud backend â†” GCP ComfyUI via secure API calls
- Image storage on WeChat Cloud object storage
- AI processing delegation to GCP with result return
- Cost optimization through proper resource allocation

### Agent Notes

*Focus on WeChat Cloud as primary platform with GCP only for AI workloads. Leverage WeChat's native integrations for authentication, payments, and messaging. This is a planning task only - deployment at project completion.*
