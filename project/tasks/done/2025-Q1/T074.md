### Description

Configure the local development environment with MySQL database, environment variables, and verify basic backend API functionality. This prepares the foundation for local development and testing before WeChat Cloud deployment.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] MySQL database server running locally (or Docker container)
- [x] Database `45ai_db` created with proper user permissions
- [x] Environment variables configured (.env file created)
- [x] Backend server starts successfully without errors
- [x] Health check endpoint (/health) responds correctly
- [x] Database health check (/health/db) passes
- [x] Basic API endpoint verification (GET /api/v1/templates)

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/config/config.go`
- **Code:** `@/backend/cmd/api/main.go`
- **Code:** `@/backend/pkg/database/`
- **Docs:** `@/docs/TECH_SPEC.md#Database`

### Completion Summary

**Environment Setup Completed:**
- ✅ MySQL 9.3.0 installed and running locally
- ✅ Database `45ai_db` created successfully
- ✅ Root user configured with empty password for development
- ✅ `.env` file created with all required environment variables

**Backend Verification:**
- ✅ Server starts successfully on port 8080
- ✅ Health check: `{"status":"healthy","service":"45AI Backend API","environment":"development"}`
- ✅ Database health: `{"database":"connected","status":"healthy"}`
- ✅ Templates API: Returns 5 mock templates successfully
- ✅ Individual template endpoint working (GET /api/v1/templates/1)

**Configuration Details:**
- Database: localhost:3306, user: root, database: 45ai_db
- JWT Secret: Development key configured
- WeChat/Payment: Mock values for development
- External APIs: Mock endpoints configured

### Agent Notes

*Local development environment fully operational. Backend APIs responding correctly. Ready for frontend integration testing and E2E test execution.*
