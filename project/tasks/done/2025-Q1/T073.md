### Description

Systematically resolve backend compilation errors and verify that the Go backend builds successfully. This phase focuses on compilation issues before proceeding to runtime testing.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All Go compilation errors are resolved
- [x] Backend builds successfully with `go build -o tmp/main cmd/api/main.go`
- [x] No import conflicts or missing dependencies 
- [x] All service interfaces properly implemented
- [x] Response models correctly structured
- [x] Identify any runtime configuration issues

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/service/`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/handler/`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/model/`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/middleware/`

### Completion Summary

**Issues Fixed:**
1. ✅ Removed unused imports (`"net/http"`, `"github.com/google/uuid"`)
2. ✅ Fixed type mismatches (int64 vs uint in GenerateToken)
3. ✅ Corrected struct field issues (CreditsUsed → Credits, sql.NullInt64 → *int)
4. ✅ Updated all ErrorResponse/SuccessResponse patterns to use helper functions
5. ✅ Added missing interface methods (GetTransactions in UserHandler)
6. ✅ Added type aliases for backward compatibility

**Runtime Discovery:**
- Backend compiles successfully ✅
- Identified database configuration requirement for next phase
- Server fails at runtime due to MySQL connection: `Error 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost'`

### Agent Notes

*All compilation errors resolved. Next phase requires database setup and environment configuration.*
