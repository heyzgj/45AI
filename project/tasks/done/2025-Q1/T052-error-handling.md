### Description

Implement comprehensive error handling middleware and structured logging for the Go backend. This includes panic recovery, error response formatting, request/response logging, and integration with a logging library like slog.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Error handling middleware catches panics and returns proper HTTP responses
- [x] Structured logging is implemented using slog or similar library
- [x] Request/response logging middleware logs all API calls
- [x] Error responses follow a consistent format
- [x] Different log levels are properly configured (info, warn, error)
- [x] Sensitive data is filtered from logs

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/TECH_SPEC.md#API-Design`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/middleware/error.go`, `@/backend/internal/middleware/logging.go`

### Agent Notes

*Proper error handling and logging are essential for debugging and monitoring in production. Ensure no sensitive data leaks in logs.*
