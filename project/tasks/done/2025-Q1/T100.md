title: Implement Global Design Tokens (token.scss)
status: To Do
epic: E09
effort: M
risk: Low
dependencies: []
assignee: CursorAgent

### Description

Create `token.scss` (or `style/tokens.scss`) defining all CSS custom properties listed in upgrade.md (brand colours, background colours, text colours, radius, shadow, grid). Import it globally via `main.ts` / `App.vue` so every component can use `var(--token)`.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `token.scss` contains every variable from table 1 of upgrade.md.
- [ ] File is injected globally for both H5 and MP.
- [ ] Existing SCSS variables ($color-primary etc.) are mapped or deprecated in favour of tokens.
- [ ] App builds with no colour regressions.

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/upgrade.md#Design Tokens`
- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/style/`

### Agent Notes

Refactor only the central colour variables first; page-level refactors come in later tasks.
