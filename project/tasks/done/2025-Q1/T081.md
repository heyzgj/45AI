### Description

Fix frontend UI issues where "即将上线" appears as inline text instead of proper popup modal, and other navigation/interaction issues on the homepage.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Locate where "即将上线" text is being displayed incorrectly
- [x] Implement proper popup/modal for "Coming Soon" features
- [x] Fix homepage feature list interaction behavior
- [x] Ensure proper wot-design-uni modal components are used
- [x] Test all interactive elements on homepage
- [x] Verify proper navigation behavior

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/pages/` (homepage files)
- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/components/`
- **Docs:** `@/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`

### Agent Notes

*Need to identify the homepage file structure first, then locate and fix the UI issue.*
