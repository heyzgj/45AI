### Description

Implement a background worker system to process queued image generation jobs asynchronously. Currently, the /api/v1/generate endpoint returns 202 (accepted) but processes jobs synchronously. This task will create a proper queue processing system for better scalability and user experience.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement background worker goroutine for processing generation queue
- [x] Create job status tracking in database (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- [x] Add GET /api/v1/generate/{job_id}/status endpoint for status polling
- [x] Add GET /api/v1/generate/{job_id} endpoint to retrieve completed images
- [x] Implement proper job lifecycle management (timeout, retry logic)
- [x] Add logging for queue processing events
- [x] Update generation handler to return job_id immediately (true async)

### Implementation Summary

**✅ Database Schema & Repository:**
- Created Generation model with full job lifecycle tracking
- Added database migration (004_create_generations_table)
- Implemented GenerationRepository with status updates and result retrieval

**✅ Enhanced Queue Service:**
- Replaced in-memory queue with channel-based channelQueueService
- Unique job ID generation using crypto/rand
- Background worker goroutines (configurable count: 2 workers)
- 100-job buffer capacity with graceful shutdown

**✅ New API Endpoints:**
- POST /api/v1/generate → Returns job_id immediately (true async)
- GET /api/v1/generate/{job_id}/status → Real-time status polling
- GET /api/v1/generate/{job_id} → Completed image retrieval

**✅ Background Processing:**
- Full processing pipeline: validation → generation → credit deduction
- Progress tracking: pending (0%) → processing (10%/50%) → completed (100%)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Automatic worker startup on server initialization

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/handler/generation_handler.go`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/repository/gemini_repository.go`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/model/generation.go`
- **Code:** `@/backend/cmd/api/main.go`

### Technical Requirements

**Queue System:**
- In-memory queue with channel-based job distribution
- Configurable number of worker goroutines
- Job persistence in MySQL for durability

**Database Schema:**
- Add status, job_id, started_at, completed_at fields to generations table
- Create proper indexes for efficient job lookups

**API Updates:**
- POST /api/v1/generate → returns job_id immediately
- GET /api/v1/generate/{job_id}/status → returns job status and progress
- GET /api/v1/generate/{job_id} → returns completed image data

### Agent Notes

*Successfully implemented reliable async processing with Go channels and goroutines. True async processing achieved with proper UX for frontend polling. All acceptance criteria met.*
