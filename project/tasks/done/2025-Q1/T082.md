### Description

Eliminate unwanted automatically generated page headers (e.g., "45AI", "Template Detail", etc.) and duplicate back buttons that appear on H5, iOS, and Mini-Program builds.  Implement a **single custom header component** that:

1. Applies platform-specific safe-area paddings.
2. Provides a **single back action** when navigation history exists.
3. Remains visually consistent with the Style Guide (minimal, thin-line icon, no extra title text).
4. Can be disabled per-page for full-screen experiences (e.g., gallery).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No default platform title bars are visible on any screen in H5, iOS, or WeChat builds.
- [ ] Each page shows at most **one** back control, positioned per design.
- [ ] Header layout passes responsive tests on iPhone 14, iPad, and common Android resolutions.
- [ ] Unit snapshot test verifies header renders without redundant text.

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/layouts/*`, `@/frontend/src/pages/*`
- **Docs:** `@/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md#Components`, `@/docs/UX_FLOW.md`

### Agent Notes

Investigate UniApp navigation bar behaviour.  Likely need to hide the default page title via `navigationStyle: "custom"` in `pages.json`, and add a reusable `FgNavbar` component with conditional rendering.
