### Description

Design and build the dual-row filter & search bar on the Home (Template Gallery) page as per provided screenshots:

- **Row 1:** Category selector chips (e.g., "All", "Popular", "New")
- **Row 2:** Search input with debounced text search and clear button.

Behaviour:
1. Works on H5, iPad, and Mini-Program resolutions.
2. Search filters templates by name in real time (client-side for now).
3. Category chip filters by predefined tags.
4. Entire component hides on scroll down and reappears on scroll up (optionalâ€“nice-to-have).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Filter/search bar appears on Home page for all devices.
- [ ] Searching updates template list with fuzzy match.
- [ ] Category chips visually match Style Guide and maintain selected state.
- [ ] Unit test covers search filtering logic.

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/pages/gallery/index.vue`, `@/frontend/src/components/TemplateFilterBar/`
- **Docs:** screenshot reference (attach later), `@/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md#Components`.

### Agent Notes

Leverage wot-design-uni components: `wd-input`, `wd-tag`.  Use Pinia store or local reactive filter state.
