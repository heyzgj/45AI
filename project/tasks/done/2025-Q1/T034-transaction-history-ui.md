### Description

Create the frontend UI to display a user's transaction history. This page will fetch the transaction data from the backend and display it in a clear and readable format.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] A new page is created at `/frontend/src/pages/history/index.vue`.
- [x] The page fetches the transaction history from the `/api/v1/me/transactions` endpoint.
- [x] It displays a list of transactions, including the description, amount, and date.
- [x] The UI adheres to the `STYLE_GUIDE.md`, focusing on clean layout and typography.
- [x] The page supports infinite scrolling to load more transactions.

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/UX_FLOW.md#Flow-3-Credit-Recharge`
- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/pages/history/index.vue`

### Agent Notes

*The transaction list should be easy to scan and understand. Use different colors to distinguish between credit purchases and generation costs.*
