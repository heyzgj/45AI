### Description

Implement health check endpoints for monitoring and load balancer integration. Include basic health status, database connectivity check, and system information endpoints.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Basic health endpoint (`GET /health`) returns 200 OK
- [x] Detailed health endpoint (`GET /health/detailed`) includes system info
- [x] Database health check verifies MySQL connection
- [x] Readiness endpoint (`GET /ready`) checks all dependencies
- [x] Liveness endpoint (`GET /live`) for Kubernetes health checks

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/TECH_SPEC.md#API-Design`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/handler/health_handler.go`

### Agent Notes

*Health checks are crucial for production monitoring and container orchestration.*
