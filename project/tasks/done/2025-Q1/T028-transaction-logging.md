### Description

Implement a system to log all credit-related transactions. This is crucial for auditing, user support, and providing users with a history of their credit usage.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The `TransactionRepository` is fully implemented with methods to `Create` and `GetByUserID`.
- [x] The `CreditService` uses the `TransactionRepository` to log a new transaction every time a user's credit balance changes.
- [x] The transaction log includes the type of transaction (e.g., `purchase`, `generation`), the amount, and a description.

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/DATA_MAP.md#transactions`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/repository/transaction_repository_impl.go`, `@/backend/internal/service/credit_service.go`

### Agent Notes

*This system is critical for maintaining a reliable and trustworthy monetization system. Ensure that all transactions are logged correctly.*
