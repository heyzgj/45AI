### Description

Create reusable Vue components implementing the spec in upgrade.md section 3 & 5. Components must consume design tokens, support slots/props, and handle platform differences (#ifdef).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `Grid4` & `GridItem` render 4 rounded items with configurable gap, radius-md, shadow-elev3.
- [ ] `Tabs` component with animated spring underline and `Chips` sub-component scrollable list.
- [ ] `Card` wrapper with 3:4 aspect-ratio image slot & body slot.
- [ ] `Modal` with transparent blur backdrop, slot content, & optional progress bar.
- [ ] All components fully unit-tested in H5.

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/upgrade.md#首页` & `#5 AI 写真馆流程`
- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/components/`

### Agent Notes

Focus on API design that can be reused across pages; minor stylistic tweaks can come later.
