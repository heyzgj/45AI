### Description

Implement a service to manage user credit balances. This service will provide methods to add, deduct, and get the current credit balance for a user.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A `CreditService` is created with methods for `AddCredits`, `DeductCredits`, and `GetBalance`.
- [ ] The service interacts with the `UserRepository` to update the user's credit balance in the database.
- [ ] The service ensures that a user's credit balance cannot go below zero.
- [ ] All credit changes are logged as transactions using the `TransactionRepository`.

### Context Binding

- **Docs:** `@/docs/DATA_MAP.md#users`, `@/docs/DATA_MAP.md#transactions`
- **Code:** `@/backend/internal/service/credit_service.go`, `@/backend/internal/repository/user_repository.go`, `@/backend/internal/repository/transaction_repository.go`

### Agent Notes

*This service will be a central part of the monetization system. Ensure that all operations are atomic and that the database is always in a consistent state.*
