### Description

Ensure long nicknames wrap or truncate gracefully within the user info card on the Profile page.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Nicknames up to 30 characters display without breaking layout.
- [ ] Ellipsis added after 20 chars with tooltip/full view on tap (nice-to-have).

### Context Binding

- **Code:** `@/frontend/src/pages/profile/index.vue`

### Agent Notes

Use CSS `text-overflow: ellipsis` or multi-line clamp; test with Chinese/emoji characters.
