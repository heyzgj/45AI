## 🎓 **Key Development Learnings**

### Multi-Level Debugging Methodology 🏆
**Breakthrough Innovation**: Developed systematic 5-level debugging approach that resolved complex, multi-symptom issues:

1. **Infrastructure Level**: Ports, processes, connectivity (backend startup issues)
2. **Database Level**: Schema, migrations, compatibility (SQLite syntax fixes)
3. **Framework Level**: Platform differences, API limitations (H5 upload solutions)
4. **Application Level**: Business logic, data flow (API integration fixes)
5. **Integration Level**: End-to-end workflows (result display resolution)

**Impact**: This methodology prevented endless debugging loops and achieved systematic progress through complex technical challenges.

### Platform-Specific Implementation 🎯
